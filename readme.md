# BEGINNING C

---

> This repo is a product of my desire to review, and become stronger in the C language after running through an Arduino kit.

## What is in this repo?

Experiments and sample code from studying **Beginning C: From Novice to Professional, Fifth Edition** by *Ivor Horton*.

This is not a complete list of every example from the book, but merely the things I wanted to practise and review.

- Programs taken directly from the book will be under ch#\source
- My experiments that are not found in the book will be under ch#\my_experiments

In that way, my experimental programs will be sorted by relevance to the chapters.
