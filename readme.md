# BEGINNING C

**NOTICE: I quit this project to learn some Java and C++ and left it alone because there is a newer version of this book.**

> This repo is a product of my desire to review, and become stronger in the C language after running through an Arduino kit.

## What is in this repo?

My experiments and solutions to exercises from studying **Beginning C: From Novice to Professional, Fifth Edition** by *Ivor Horton*.
