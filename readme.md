# BEGINNING C

---

This repo is a product of my desire to review, and become stronger in the C language after running through an Arduino kit.

Experiments and sample code while studying Beginning C: From Novice to Professional, Fifth Edition by Ivor Horton. It is not a complete list of every example from the book, but merely the things I wanted to practise and review. I will indicate where I have taken samples directly from the source material, and include the relevant page and chapter.
