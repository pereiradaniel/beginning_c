// Exercise 4-2
// Write a program that will output the printable characters for character
// code values from 0 to 127. Output each character code along with its symbol with two
// characters to a line. Make sure the columns are aligned. (Hint: You can use the isgraph()
// function thatâ€™s declared in ctype.h to determine when a character is printable.)
