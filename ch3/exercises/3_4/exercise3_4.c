// Exercise 3-4

// Modify the last example in the chapter that implemented a calculator so
// that the user is given the option to enter y or Y to carry out another calculation, and n or
// N to end the program. (Note: You’ll have to use a goto statement for this here, but you’ll
// learn a better way of doing this in the next chapter.)
